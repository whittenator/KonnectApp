</ul>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>How do we protect your information?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>What information might be disclosed to third parties?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b></b></span><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">We will exercise maximum efforts to protect the anonymity and personal privacy of every Member from third parties. There is one exception to this.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We reserve the right to share information you provide (including any identifying information you provide) with legal authorities if it is, in our sole opinion, necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected fraud, situation involving threats or potential harm to the physical safety of any person, or if required by law (such as if required by a subpoena, court order or other legal means).</span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">We do not sell, rent or otherwise share your personal information to or with any third party.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We do aggregate demographic information and disclose such information, in aggregate, to partners and use it for other marketing and promotional purposes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However, in these situations, we do not disclose any information that could be used to personally identify you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Certain information, such as your password, is never disclosed at all, even in the aggregate.</span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">We do not allow third parties to send promotional email to our Members without your express consent, in advance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We may send administrative emails to confirm Member registrations or to update Members concerning new services or opportunities with us. Some of these emails may contain information about the services of our partners. We may send out promotional emails on behalf of our partners to those Members who have demonstrated an interest in receiving such solicitations.</span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">We cooperate with all law enforcement inquiries and with all third parties to enforce their intellectual property or other rights. Unfortunately, due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. For example, we may be forced to disclose information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or private communications will remain private.</span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">This mobile app may collect and pass to third parties precise geolocation information linked to your mobile device or advertising identifiers and may do when you use the app or when the app runs in the background on your device.  That information may be used by third parties to customize ads in this app or in other apps:  for instance, if your device is often located at or near music venues, you might receive offers for music tickets (even when you are not at a music venue).  The information also may be used for market or other research regarding aggregated traffic patterns:  for instance, a company that analyzes shopping trends might use the information to learn whether more or fewer devices are seen near malls or in other shopping districts.
      
      We automatically collect usage information that does not identify an individual user (“Usage Data”). For example, when you download and use the Services on a mobile device, we automatically collect information such as your device type, operating system version and type, certain device settings, device time zone, device carrier, current IP address, applications installed on the device, and platform-specific advertising identifiers. We may also collect location information, such as your device GPS coordinates, unless you configure your device operating system settings to prevent our collection of location information. Additionally, each time you use the Site we automatically collect the type of web browser you use, your operating system, your Internet Service Provider, your IP address, the pages you view, and the time and duration of your visits to the Site. We use this information to enhance the services we offer, provide targeted advertising, and to help us understand how people use the Site and Services. Aggregated device data, including location and usage data, is also measured for the purposes of targeted advertising and market research by X-Mode Social, Inc. For further information, please see our Partners’ Privacy Policies.
      
      If you do not want this information to be linked to your device, you may go to your device “settings” (which are somewhat different for iOS and Android devices) and opt out of interest-based or personalized advertising.  You may also prevent location from being collected by this or other apps, through your device settings (but this may affect the functionality of certain app features).</span></li>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>A Note About Changes To This Policy</b></span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the Konnect </span><span class="s2">Terms of Service</span><span class="s1"> and may be revised over time as new features are added to the Site. We will post those changes prominently so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner that differs from what was stated at the time of collection, we will notify you via e-mail. If we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect Member information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on the Site notifying Members of the change. In addition to the notice on the Site, in some cases, we will also e-mail Members who have opted to receive communications from us notifying them of the change in our privacy practices.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
